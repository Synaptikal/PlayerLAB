# AI Freeze Loop Protection Protocol

## ðŸš¨ Internal AI Protection System

### Freeze Detection Triggers:
- **Repetitive Commands**: Same command run 3+ times
- **Stuck Patterns**: Similar responses or actions repeated
- **Terminal Hangs**: Commands taking >30 seconds without output
- **Error Loops**: Same error message appearing repeatedly
- **Memory Issues**: Large file operations or complex scripts failing

### Protection Mechanisms:

#### 1. Command Diversity Check
- Before running any command, check if it's been run recently
- If same command >2 times in last 5 minutes â†’ SWITCH APPROACH
- Use alternative methods or break down into smaller steps

#### 2. Response Pattern Detection
- If giving similar responses >3 times â†’ CHANGE STRATEGY
- Switch from automation to manual steps
- Use different tools or approaches

#### 3. Timeout Protection
- Any operation taking >30 seconds â†’ ABORT AND RETRY
- Break complex operations into smaller chunks
- Use simpler, more direct methods

#### 4. Error Recovery Protocol
- Same error >2 times â†’ DIAGNOSE ROOT CAUSE
- Check if it's a system issue vs. command issue
- Try alternative tools or manual intervention

### Emergency Break Patterns:
1. **Switch Tools**: If one tool is failing, use another
2. **Simplify**: Break complex operations into simple steps
3. **Manual Override**: Use direct commands instead of scripts
4. **User Alert**: Inform user of potential freeze and ask for direction

### Current Status Check:
- Am I repeating the same approach?
- Is the user getting frustrated with my methods?
- Should I switch to a different strategy?

### Implementation:
- Monitor command history
- Track response patterns
- Set internal timeouts
- Always have fallback methods ready
